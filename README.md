This is a productivity extension that shows what is on your calendar, what work you have to do that day, and tracks your goals.

View a demo in DEMO and DEMO_Arduino

Features:
- Shows current song playing on your Spotify player
- Keeps track of homework, quizzes, tests, projects, and tasks you have to do for each of your classes
- If you add a task / homework with a day of week inside parentheses: ex. Lab 10 (MWTh) then the first, third, and fourth little balls will light up, indicating you have work to do that day
- Calendar widget that shows a weekly preview with title, day of week, time, and location
- By clicking on the home icon at the top, I can connect to my arduino and it will bring data like time, local temperature, spotify song and artist, and next task.

TODO:
- Make extension generic for others to use
